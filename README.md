1. **Restart your WSL session** to ensure all environment variables are loaded
2. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   go version
   asdf list go
   gopls version
   ```

## Version Management

Switch between installed Go versions:
```bash
# Set global Go version
asdf global go 1.23.3

# Set local Go version for current project
asdf local go 1.24.5

# List installed versions
asdf list go

# List all available versions
asdf list-all go
```
